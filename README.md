This is the final project of the coding foundations module which is a replica of an older CodePen.io landing page.

It utilizes css and html with flexbox and css grid.

As per the requirements the project does include:

Navbar that includes "Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron (does not need to actually dropdown).
Images - use available tools to recreate colors, etc.
Don't worry about replicating any functionality features such as drop-down, scrolling, etc. Simply replicate the landing page.

In this module I was never taught SCSS and I'm not a rubyist. So I havent included any SCSS.
